1. Do we need to have storage classes corresponding to each test_<integration name>.py file we have?
2. We currently have the following integrations done:
    - [x] Sheets
    - [x] Gmail
    - [ ] LinkedIn
    - [ ] Handshake
    - [ ] Slack
    - [ ] Discord
    - [ ] Outlook
    Do we need to create a storage class for each of these?
    If so, what should the name of the class be?
    What should the attributes and methods of the class be?
    What should the __init__ method of the class be?
    What should the __str__ method of the class be?
    What should the __repr__ method of the class be?
